# the-line-app

A simple tram/bus timetable app written in Flutter (De Lijn - Belgium)

## Development

This app was developed for educational purpose only. I will use fluter as base framework for the app and explore how to make API request to HTTP and handle App permissions.

## API

The API I am using comes from the national public transportation service in Belgium De Lijn. I have discovered the API thanks to Chome Dev tools and Postman.
